## 🎯 Introduction
The AI-Powered SQL Chatbot is an intelligent assistant designed to allow users to interact with databases using natural language (NL). This chatbot enables non-technical users, or those without advanced SQL knowledge, to access and retrieve data from a database simply by asking questions in conversational language. It helps businesses and teams to gain insights from their data without needing to write complex SQL queries themselves

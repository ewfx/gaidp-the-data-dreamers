## 🎯 Introduction
The AI-Powered SQL Chatbot is an intelligent assistant designed to allow users to interact with databases using natural language (NL). This chatbot enables non-technical users, or those without advanced SQL knowledge, to access and retrieve data from a database simply by asking questions in conversational language. It helps businesses and teams to gain insights from their data without needing to write complex SQL queries themselves

## 💡 Inspiration
This solution combines natural language processing (NLP) with SQL query generation to convert user queries into database-compatible SQL statements. Whether the data resides in relational databases, data warehouses, or cloud-based services, the chatbot can connect, interpret, and query the data to return relevant insights

**Target Audience who will get benefits from this solution :**

**Business Intelligence (BI)**: Enables teams to quickly access and interpret business data (e.g., sales, revenue, user engagement) without needing advanced technical skills.

**Customer Support**: Helps customer service teams quickly retrieve relevant customer data or product information.

**Marketing Analytics**: Marketing teams can ask the chatbot about campaign performance, customer behavior, or sales trends without manually running SQL queries.

**Product Development**: Teams can use the chatbot to access product usage data, customer feedback, or bug reports.

**Finance and Accounting:** Finance teams can quickly query financial data (e.g., profits, expenses, forecasts) and produce ad-hoc reports.
